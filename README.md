## Development

For local development, contributing to packages, running quality checks, and publishing, see [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Agent marketplace plugins

The repository includes an internal marketplace package that generates plugin artifacts for Claude Code and GitHub Copilot CLI:

- [packages/agent-marketplace](./packages/agent-marketplace/README.md)

Use it to manage normalized skill and agent content, source pinning metadata, and generated plugin outputs for both ecosystems.

## Icon policy

- Use `lucide-react` for all product and story iconography.
- Do not introduce emoji icons or ad hoc inline SVG icon implementations in components/stories.

### Recommended install flow (GitHub marketplace)

Prefer marketplace-based installs from GitHub over direct local-path installs.

- Claude Code team marketplaces:
  - https://code.claude.com/docs/en/discover-plugins#configure-team-marketplaces
- Copilot plugin marketplaces:
  - https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/customize-copilot/plugins-marketplace

For this repository, publish or reference the marketplace metadata in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and `.github/plugin/marketplace.json`, then install by plugin name from the configured marketplace.
