/**
 * Collapses a raw URL search value to the text a param means, or `undefined`
 * when it means nothing.
 *
 * ## Why a normalizer is needed at all
 *
 * `validateSearch` never sees the raw query text. `parseSearch` has already
 * decoded it, and decoding coerces spellings, so a parser written against
 * `string` meets four other shapes in production:
 *
 * | URL              | value reaching the parser |
 * | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
 * | `?rows=25`       | the number `25`           |
 * | `?dense=true`    | the boolean `true`        |
 * | `?q=` or `?q`    | the empty string `''`     |
 * | `?q=a&q=b`       | the array `['a', 'b']`    |
 *
 * How much coercion depends on the grammar the router was built with, and both
 * common choices coerce:
 *
 * - `parseSearchWith(JSON.parse)` — the router's **default**. It applies the qss
 *   decode above and then `JSON.parse`s every value still a string, so `?v=1e5`
 *   arrives as `100000`, `?v=null` as `null`, and `?v=-0` as `0`.
 * - `parseSearchWith((value) => value)` — the identity parser, for apps whose
 *   params are plain text. Stops after the qss decode, so those three stay
 *   strings.
 *
 * A hand-written `parseSearch` is the decoder rather than a stage after it, so
 * it can opt out entirely — but then it owns the whole grammar.
 *
 * ## What is and is not promised
 *
 * **Promised: idempotence.** Feeding this function's own output back through a
 * render-and-redecode round trip returns that output unchanged, under either
 * grammar above. That is the property the entry-time cleanup needs to terminate.
 *
 * **Not promised: byte-preserved URL text.** Under the default grammar `?v=1e5`
 * canonicalizes to `100000` and `?v=-0` to `0`, because the value really was
 * decoded to a number.
 *
 * That rewrite is the *grammar's*, not the cleanup's, and it costs no redirect:
 * the router restringifies the decoded search whenever it builds a location, and
 * its own mount-time commit is what puts the canonical form in the address bar.
 * The cleanup's rewrites are the ones that show up as a redirect. Either way it
 * is one rewrite and not a loop — the second pass is stable, and
 * `settleEntryUrl` pins the settled form of both under both grammars.

/*
 * ## Writing a param of your own
 *
 * The total-and-idempotent contract (see `toSearchText`) is what
 * `createValidatedSearchRedirect` needs to terminate, so a custom param has to
 * keep it. Three rules cover it:
 *
 *  1. Build on `toSearchText`, so the decoder's coercions are already absorbed.
 *  2. Keep the transform a pure function of that text — no state, no clock, no
 *     counter. A param that grows or varies per call cannot converge.
 *  3. Return absent, or a value that renders to text this module maps back to
 *     that same value. Notably `null` is *not* such a value: it is neither
 *     dropped as absent nor stable across both grammars.
 *
 * `settleEntryUrl` (from the `/testing` subpath) is the executable check — point
 * it at the real route tree and it fails on a param that does not converge.
