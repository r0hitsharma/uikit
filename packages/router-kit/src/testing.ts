 * Follows an entry URL through every `beforeLoad` redirect to the URL that

 * applied, so a schema whose output fails to re-validate to itself rewrites the
 * same URL forever. In a browser that is a hung tab with a spinning address bar;
 * here it is a thrown error naming the cycle. The same throw catches a cleanup
 * whose `stringifySearch` disagrees with the router's, because the disagreement
 * is exactly a failure to converge.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does *not* assert
 *
 * A **pushed** redirect would be the other invisible trap — a rejected URL left
 * in the back history, so the back button walks the user into the redirect
 * again. It is not asserted here because a `beforeLoad` redirect cannot push:
 * every path that follows one (`followRedirect`, and the `matchRoutes` rejection
 * path beside it) spreads the redirect's options and then overrides
 * `replace: true`. Asserting `replace` here would therefore have been worse than
 * redundant — it would fail a perfectly good `throw redirect({ to: '/login' })`,
 * which leaves `replace` undefined and which the router replaces anyway. The
 * flag is still reported on {@link EntryRedirect} so a spec can pin what its own
 * redirect *declares*.
 *
 * @throws when the chain has not settled within `maxHops`, when a matched
 * route's `validateSearch` rejected a hop, or when a `beforeLoad` throws
 * something that is not a redirect.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { settleEntryUrl } from '@r0hitsharma/router-kit/testing';
 *
 * import { router } from '../src/router';
 *
 * it.each(['/', '/items?sort=bogus', '/legacy/path?item=42'])(
