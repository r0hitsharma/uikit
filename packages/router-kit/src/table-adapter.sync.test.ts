// Imported from SOURCE, by relative path, on purpose. Two constraints rule out
// the package specifier `@r0hitsharma/design-system`:
//
//  1. Its `exports` map resolves to `dist/`, so this test would only pass after
//     the design system had been built, coupling this package's test job to
//     another package's build step.
//  2. The design system is not a dependency of this package at all — see the
//     rationale on the local interface. A real import in `src/` would create
//     one; this file is excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`, so nothing reaches
//     the published output.

/**
 * `UrlSyncedTableStateAdapter` restates the design system's seam because a
 * type-only import of a non-dependency would publish an unresolvable module
 * reference — which `skipLibCheck` silently widens to `any` rather than
 * failing. This test is what keeps the restatement honest: a property added,
 * removed, or retyped upstream fails here instead of leaving this package
 * producing an object that no longer fits the hook it exists to feed.
 *
 * Asserted by `tsc` (via `npm run type:check`) as much as by vitest, so the
 * assertions live in a function that is never called.
