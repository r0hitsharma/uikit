/**
 * The promise-safety rules, on their own so a non-React consumer can merge them
 * into `base` instead of taking the whole React preset:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import baseConfig from '@r0hitsharma/oxlint-config/base';
 * import { typeAwareRules } from '@r0hitsharma/oxlint-config/type-aware';
 *
 * export default {
 *   ...baseConfig,
 *   rules: { ...baseConfig.rules, ...typeAwareRules },
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * None of these run unless oxlint is invoked with `--type-aware` and the
 * `oxlint-tsgolint` package is installed. Without both they still appear in
 * `--print-config`, which is what made them read as coverage when they were
 * inert.
