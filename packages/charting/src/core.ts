/**
 * `@r0hitsharma/charting/core` — everything this package offers that does
 * NOT import `@visx/*`.
 *
 * This subpath exists because of one measured fact: `@visx/xychart` publishes a
 * single barrel entry, so ANY import from it — `XYChart`, but equally
 * `DataContext` or `buildChartTheme` — costs ~83 kB minified / ~29 kB gzipped
 * before tree-shaking has anything left to remove. Everything re-exported here
 * bundles to ~8 kB minified / ~3.5 kB gzipped in total, so a consumer can put
 * the chart tokens, a legend, a data-table fallback or the downsamplers in an
 * eagerly-loaded chunk and still keep visx entirely behind a dynamic
 * `import()` of `@r0hitsharma/charting/xychart` (or `/primitives`).
 *
 * Everything here is also re-exported from the root barrel; this subpath is
 * about which chunk the code lands in, not about which names exist.
