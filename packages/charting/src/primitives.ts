/**
 * `@r0hitsharma/charting/primitives` — hand-composition primitives that
 * need visx, but NOT `@visx/xychart`.
 *
 * A chart that steps off the single-plot `<XYChart>` happy path (faceted
 * small-multiples, a custom stacked area, a sparkline, a sorted distribution)
 * composes from these: scales, shapes, curves, the token-themed standalone
 * axes, and the brush/zoom overlays. Measured cost is the union of the visx
 * packages actually used — `@visx/axis` ~49 kB, `@visx/scale` + `@visx/curve` +
 * `@visx/group` ~50 kB, `@visx/zoom` ~34 kB, `@visx/brush` ~28 kB, `@visx/shape`
 * ~14 kB minified. A union, not a sum: those figures are each measured alone,
 * and axis/brush/shape all reach `@visx/scale` and its d3 vendor modules, which
 * the tier pays for once (~145 kB together, against ~175 kB added up). All of
 * it is well under, and independent of, the ~83 kB `@visx/xychart` floor that
 * `/xychart` carries. Within one import the package
 * is `"sideEffects": false` ESM, so a bundler tree-shakes down to the visx
 * packages a call site really touches; the subpath is what keeps `<XYChart>`
 * out of the chunk entirely.
 *
 * Everything here is also re-exported from the root barrel.
