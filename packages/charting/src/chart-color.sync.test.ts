// Imported from SOURCE, by relative path, on purpose. Two constraints rule out
// the package specifier `@r0hitsharma/design-system`:
//
//  1. Its `exports` map resolves to `dist/`, so this test would only pass after
//     the design system had been built. CI's test job builds only the packages
//     whose specs need it, and adding another such coupling is worse than a
//     path.
//  2. The design system is an OPTIONAL peer of this package. A real import in
//     `src/` would make it mandatory; this file is excluded from
//     `tsconfig.build.json`, so nothing reaches the published output.

/**
 * `chartColorTokens` restates the design system's token names because charting
 * must produce `var(...)` strings (with fallbacks) without importing it — see
 * the rationale on that constant. This test is what keeps the restatement
 * honest: a token added, removed, or renamed upstream fails here rather than
 * silently leaving `ChartColorToken` describing a contract that no longer
 * exists.
