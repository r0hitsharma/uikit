// Fail if any workspace package the preview renders has sources newer than its
// compiled `dist/` — i.e. the preview would bundle a stale build of it.
//
// This package imports `@r0hitsharma/*` through each package's `exports`,
// which resolve to `dist/`. Ladle bundles that compiled output; it never sees
// the package's `src/`. So editing a component and re-rendering without
// rebuilding that package renders the PREVIOUS component — which of course
// matches the PREVIOUS baseline. A real visual change then passes a snapshot
// run that asserted nothing, and `--update-snapshots` rewrites nothing because
// nothing differed. Silent under-update, reported as success.
//
// `snapshot:update` and Playwright's `webServer` both build the whole workspace
// to make that impossible; this check is what proves the build actually
// happened, so the guarantee cannot quietly rot back (CI runs it between its
// build and render steps).
//
// Cheap and render-free, in the spirit of check-orphan-snapshots: no build, no
// browser, just stat(2). Every package below builds with `tsc -p` and no
// `incremental`, which emits every output on every run — so a build always
// leaves `dist/` newer than its inputs, and a failure here means a build was
// skipped rather than that timestamps drifted.
//
// Every ambiguity resolves towards reporting. Both call sites build first and
// check second, so a false "rebuild this" costs one warm build; a false "all
// fresh" is the silent under-update this file exists to prevent.
