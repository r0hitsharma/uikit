# @r0hitsharma/http-client-react

TanStack Query bindings for `@r0hitsharma/http-client-core`.

The generated OpenAPI `paths` type **is** the endpoint definition. Methods,
paths, params, request bodies, response types, and error bodies are all read off
it, so there is no second registry of endpoints to keep in step with the API.
See [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md) for the contract and its deliberate limits.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @r0hitsharma/http-client-react @r0hitsharma/http-client-core '@tanstack/react-query@^5.89.0' react react-dom
```

`@tanstack/react-query` is a **peer** dependency, so the app owns the version and
the `QueryClient` this package's hooks and options talk to is the same instance
the app's own `useQuery` calls use. See [peer
dependencies](#peer-dependencies) for why the range starts at 5.89.0.

## Usage

### 1. Generate types and create the api

```bash
npx uikit-openapi-generate --schema openapi.json --output src/api.types.ts
```

```ts
// src/api.ts
import { createApiClient, createQueryApi } from '@r0hitsharma/http-client-react';

import type { paths } from './api.types';

const client = createApiClient<paths>('/api');

// Both the paths type and the tag vocabulary are inferred from the arguments.
// Do not pass type arguments explicitly: naming one turns inference off for the
// rest, and `TTag` silently widens to `string`.
export const api = createQueryApi(client, {
  tags: ['positions', 'position', 'alerts'],
});
```

### 2. Provide a QueryClient

```tsx
import { createQueryClient, HttpProvider } from '@r0hitsharma/http-client-react';

const queryClient = createQueryClient();

export function App() {
  return (
    <HttpProvider client={queryClient}>
      <Dashboard />
    </HttpProvider>
  );
}
```

`createQueryClient()` is a `QueryClient` with two defaults changed from
react-query's, both because react-query's are tuned for a document-shaped app
rather than a data-dense one:

| Default | Value | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `refetchOnWindowFocus` | `false` | Alt-tabbing back to a dashboard should not reload every panel. Freshness is `staleTime` and explicit invalidation, which the app controls. |
| `retry` | status-aware | React-query retries every rejection three times, so a 422 costs four round trips to report a validation error the server decided on the first. |

The retry policy, exactly:

- **5xx** — retried. The request was well formed; the server was not well.
- **408, 425, 429** — retried. Request timeout, TLS early-data refusal, and rate
  limiting are all transient conditions rather than bad requests.
- **every other 4xx** — not retried. A 401, a 404, a 422: repeating the request
  unchanged produces the same answer more slowly.
- **anything below 400** — not retried. A 304 on the error path is a caching
  problem, not a flaky one.
- **a rejection with no status at all** — retried. A dropped connection, a CORS
  refusal, an abort, or a middleware that threw leaves no evidence except that
  the request did not complete, and treating that as fatal makes one dropped
  socket a visible error.
- **a `ZodResponseValidationError`** — not retried, the one exception to the line
  above. `createZodResponseMiddleware` rejects after a 2xx arrived and parsed, so
  the request *did* complete and the body will be the same on the next attempt.

Two retries, so with react-query's exponential `retryDelay` an error reaches the
screen about three seconds after the first failure. Mutations are not retried at
all — a `POST` that reached the server may have applied before the failure, and
this package cannot tell which.

With focus refetching off, **the app owns error recovery**. A query that has
exhausted its retries will not try again on its own while the tab stays open and
the connection stays up, and react-query keeps serving the last successful `data`
next to `status: 'error'` — so an expired session reads as current numbers unless
the screen says otherwise. Render the error and offer a refetch.

Nothing else is set. `staleTime` most of all: how long a screen may show a stale
number is a product decision, and a package-level guess would be wrong quietly.

#### Changing the defaults

`createQueryClient` takes react-query's own `QueryClientConfig` and every field
of it wins. The merge is per-option, so replacing one default keeps the rest:

```ts
// Keeps `refetchOnWindowFocus: false`; replaces only the retry policy.
const queryClient = createQueryClient({
  defaultOptions: { queries: { retry: 5, staleTime: 30_000 } },
});
```

A `queries` key present with the value `undefined` is **not** an override — it
is dropped before the merge, and the default stands. So the else-branch of a
conditional override leaves the shipped policy in place rather than reverting it
to react-query's `retry ?? 3`:

```ts
// `retry` is the package predicate whenever `cond` is false.
createQueryClient({
  defaultOptions: { queries: { retry: cond ? false : undefined } },
});
```

To keep the status policy and change only how many times it asks again, or to
drop one error out of it, compose the exported predicates rather than restating
them:

```ts
import {
  createQueryClient,
  isRetryableError,
  shouldRetryRequest,
} from '@r0hitsharma/http-client-react';

createQueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      // Same statuses, five retries — six attempts. `failureCount` is the
      // number of failures *before* this attempt, so it is 0 on the first.
      retry: (failureCount, error) => failureCount < 5 && isRetryableError(error),
      // Or: the shipped policy, minus one application-specific error.
      // retry: (count, error) =>
      //   isSessionExpired(error) ? false : shouldRetryRequest(count, error),
    },
  },
});
```

`isRetryableHttpStatus(status)` is exported too, for a predicate built from
something other than an `HttpRequestError`.

#### Reporting errors once, centrally

Not shipped, deliberately: a `QueryCache.onError` that turns a failed query into
a toast. The wiring is three lines, but the useful half of it is the sink — your
notification system — and the `meta` field it reads has to be typed by
augmenting react-query's `Register` interface, which is a *global* declaration
an app can only make once. A package that made it would collide with the app's
own. So this stays a recipe rather than an export:

```ts
// src/query-client.ts
declare module '@tanstack/react-query' {
  interface Register {
    queryMeta: { errorMessage?: string };
  }
}

export const queryClient = createQueryClient({
  queryCache: new QueryCache({
    onError: (error, query) => {
      // Only queries that opted in by declaring the message.
      const message = query.meta?.errorMessage;
      if (message) toast.error(message, { description: error.message });
    },
  }),
});
```

`meta` rides through on the per-call options: `api.queryOptions('get',
'/positions', undefined, { meta: { errorMessage: 'Could not load positions' } })`.

### 3. Query in a component

```tsx
import { isHttpRequestError } from '@r0hitsharma/http-client-react';
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';

import { api } from './api';

function PositionPanel({ id }: { id: string }) {
  const { data, isPending, error } = useQuery(
    api.queryOptions(
      'get',
      '/positions/{id}',
      { params: { path: { id }, query: { expand: 'collateral' } } },
      { tags: ['position'], staleTime: 30_000 },
    ),
  );

  if (isPending) return <LoadingIndicator />;
  if (error) {
    // `status` and the parsed error body are only on HTTP failures; a transport
    // error or a validation middleware rejects with a plain Error.
    return (
      <ErrorState
        message={isHttpRequestError(error) ? `HTTP ${error.status}` : error.message}
      />
    );
  }

  return <PositionSummary position={data} />;
}
```

`data` is typed from the operation's 2xx response, the `params` object is typed
from its parameters, and the query key is derived — `['get', '/positions/{id}',
{ path: { id }, query: { expand: 'collateral' } }]` — so two components asking
for the same thing share one cache entry regardless of how they spell the init.

### 4. Mutate, and invalidate by tag

```tsx
import { useMutation } from '@tanstack/react-query';

import { api } from './api';

function ClosePositionButton({ id }: { id: string }) {
  const { mutate, isPending } = useMutation(
    api.mutationOptions('post', '/positions/{id}/close', {
      // A tag, or a callback that derives tags from the mutation's own result.
      invalidates: ['position', (closed) => (closed.liquidated ? 'alerts' : [])],
    }),
  );

  return (
    <Button
      disabled={isPending}
      onClick={() => mutate({ params: { path: { id } } })}
    >
      Close
    </Button>
  );
}
```

The mutation variables are the operation's init, so the body and params are
typed. On success, every query registered under an invalidated tag is
invalidated through the `QueryClient` react-query passes to the mutation — no
`useQueryClient` call and no key factory at the call site.

### 5. Middleware, including response validation

```ts
import {
  createApiClient,
  createQueryApi,
  createZodResponseMiddleware,
  type QueryApiMiddleware,
} from '@r0hitsharma/http-client-react';

import openApiDocument from '../openapi.json';
import type { paths } from './api.types';

const logSlowRequests: QueryApiMiddleware = async (ctx, next) => {
  const startedAt = performance.now();
  try {
    return await next();
  } finally {
    const elapsed = performance.now() - startedAt;
    if (elapsed > 1_000) {
      console.warn(`slow ${ctx.method} ${ctx.path}: ${Math.round(elapsed)}ms`);
    }
  }
};

export const api = createQueryApi(createApiClient<paths>('/api'), {
  tags: ['positions', 'position', 'alerts'],
  middleware: [
    logSlowRequests,
    createZodResponseMiddleware({
      document: openApiDocument,
      schemas: { 'get /positions/{id}': 'Position' },
      // Report drift instead of breaking the screen. Omit to reject instead.
      onInvalid: (error) => console.warn(error.message, error.issues),
    }),
  ],
});
```

Middleware is onion-style over the *parsed result*: `[a, b]` means `a` runs
before `b` on the way in and after it on the way out. A per-call
`middleware: [...]` on `queryOptions`/`mutationOptions` is appended innermost,
which is how you opt one query into response validation rather than all of them.
For middleware that needs the raw `Request`/`Response`, use `openapi-fetch`'s own
`client.use()`.

### Targeting the cache directly

```ts
// Exactly one query.
queryClient.getQueryData(api.queryKey('get', '/positions/{id}', { params: { path: { id } } }));

// Every cached variant of an endpoint — the key's first two elements are the
// operation, and react-query prefix-matches.
await queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['get', '/positions'] });

// Everything under a tag.
await api.invalidateTags(queryClient, ['positions']);
```

`sanitizeQueryInit` and `buildQueryApiKey` are exported for anything that needs
to derive a key outside an api instance.

### Prefetching: pass `queryOptions`, never `queryKey`

`api.queryKey(…)` targets an entry that already exists. `api.queryOptions(…)`
*describes* one. Prefetching creates an entry, so it takes the options:

```ts
// Right: one argument, and it is the whole options object.
await queryClient.prefetchQuery(
  api.queryOptions(
    'get',
    '/positions/{id}',
    { params: { path: { id } } },
    { tags: ['position'], staleTime: 30_000 },
  ),
);
```

```ts
// Wrong, and it typechecks, and it warms the cache, and it still costs you.
await queryClient.prefetchQuery({
  queryKey: api.queryKey('get', '/positions/{id}', { params: { path: { id } } }),
  queryFn: () => fetch(`/api/positions/${id}`).then((r) => r.json()),
});
```

The key is identical in both, so the entry lands where the component will look
for it and the prefetch appears to work. What the second form drops is
everything else the options carry:

- **`staleTime`.** Absent, it falls back to react-query's `0`, so the entry is
  stale the instant it is written. The component mounts, reads it, and refetches
  immediately — you paid for the request and saved nothing. This is the failure
  that looks most like success: data does appear, just after a second round
  trip.
- **The middleware chain.** A hand-written `queryFn` bypasses the api instance
  entirely, so response validation, auth headers, and every other middleware do
  not run. The cached data was never checked, and the component that reads it
  cannot tell.
- **`tags`.** Registration is a side effect of building the options, so an entry
  prefetched around them belongs to no tag and `invalidateTags` skips it
  silently — see [the registry's boundary](./DESIGN.md#the-registrys-boundary).
- **The error type.** `api.queryOptions` rejects with `HttpRequestError`; a raw
  `fetch` resolves a 404 into whatever `r.json()` makes of the error body, and
  the entry caches that as *data*.

The same rule holds for `fetchQuery` and `ensureQueryData`, and for a router
loader that warms the cache before a route renders. If you find yourself writing
a `queryFn` next to an `api.queryKey(…)` call, the options object you want
already exists.

One caveat on the last line: `invalidateTags` reaches only the endpoints some
`api.queryOptions(…, { tags })` call has registered. An entry written straight
through `setQueryData`, or restored by SSR/persisted-cache hydration, is cached
under a perfectly good key that the tag has never heard of, and the invalidation
skips it silently. Register the endpoint once at module scope, or invalidate by
key prefix — see [the registry's
boundary](./DESIGN.md#the-registrys-boundary).

## Not in v1

Optimistic updates, cache updaters, cross-tab cache sync, infinite queries, and
`POST`-backed reads are deliberately out of scope — see
[DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md#deliberately-out-of-v1). The mock layer is a separate
package: [http-client-msw](../http-client-msw) keys its handlers off the same
`paths` type, so a fixture and the request it stands in for are described by one
source.

## Peer dependencies

- `react`, `react-dom` — `^19.0.0`
- `@tanstack/react-query` — `^5.89.0`

The react-query floor is not arbitrary. `mutationOptions` invalidates tags
through the `QueryClient` react-query hands to the mutation callback, which means
it needs the four-argument `onSuccess(data, variables, onMutateResult, context)`
signature and `context.client`. Both arrived in **5.89.0**; the release before it
(5.87.4) passes three arguments and no client, so the package does not typecheck
against it. Anything from 5.89.0 up works — the package is developed against the
latest 5.x.

Keeping react-query a peer rather than a dependency is what guarantees one
`QueryClient` and one cache: two copies in the module graph would give the
`HttpProvider` and the app's own hooks separate caches.
