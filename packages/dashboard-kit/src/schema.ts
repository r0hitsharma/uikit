/**
 * `@r0hitsharma/dashboard-kit` — the generic, manifest-driven dashboard
 * engine.
 *
 * Three concerns stay SEPARABLE rather than conflated the way Grafana (flat,
 * absolute `gridPos` + string-interpolated query blobs) or Superset (three
 * disconnected config blobs) do:
 *
 *   1. `layout`  — a recursive composition tree (Vega-Lite `hconcat`/
 *      `vconcat` style), independent of what each leaf renders.
 *   2. `widgets` — a flat, id-keyed registry of widget nodes (`{component,
 *      props, dataBinding}`), each resolved through a string -> component
 *      registry key (see `registry.tsx`).
 *   3. `dataBinding` — a typed `{source, fields}` pointer at a data source,
 *      uniform across whatever transport a consuming app resolves `source`
 *      ids against (live tail, replay cursor, a REST poll, ...).
 *
 * The one addition none of Grafana/Superset/Perspective/Vega-Lite model as
 * part of the *widget* node itself is `interaction.reads`/`writes`: the
 * shared-selection keys a widget consumes or produces. Declaring it here
 * makes cross-filtering a declared, auditable property of the manifest
 * instead of implicit wiring buried in component code — see `interaction.ts`
 * for how those keys reach a real interaction store.
